Make a list of vulnerability types you might be interested in including. Make this list as long as you can, and annotate it with links as appropriate.
Pick several of these vulnerabilities that you could install into your VM so that an attacker could chain them together to go from "nmap from the outside" to "shell with whoami==root". Write this chain of vulnerabilities as a concise, step-by-step description of actions the attacker should take to get a root shell.
Write a brief description of the fictional person/people/organization your machine will be owned by. This will help you refine your design later to make its vulnerabilities realistic in context.
